This package includes non-native tools for C++ that I plan to use as a side project. Everything released from this repository from each change will include a fully tested implementation. If there is a bug let me know. Be familiar with the information in the comments and the contents of this file to understand the pros/cons of the data structures or algorithms. Some information that will be useful are a few of the folder abreviations. 'ds_' stands for data structures & 'algo_' stands for algorithms.
